## Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly.

0-main.c, main.h >> Multiple mains.

1-main.c >> Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

2-largest_number.c, main.h >> This program does not print the largest of three integers. Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h >> This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration. Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
